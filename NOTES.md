# Rust

-   Compiled low level general purpose language
-   designed as an alternative for C and C++
-   Main advantage over C is memory safety
    -   this means no null pointer exceptions
-   created by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla in 2010

## Hello World

```rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Installing Rust

Install from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Includes:

-   `rustc` the rust compiler
-   `rustup` a tool for updating rust
-   `cargo` rust's official package manager

## The Book

Rust has an official book that is a great way to learn rust.
You can read it for free on the rust website https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

## Variables

here is how to make a variable

```rs
let x: i32 = 5;
```

or

```rs
let x = 5;
```

type annotations are optional if they can be inferred

variables are immutable my default (like `final` in Java)

to make them mutable add `mut`

```rs
let mut x = 5;
x = 6;
```

Rust also has constants which are evaluated at compile time (like `#define` in C/C++)

```rs
const X: i32 = 5;
```

types are not optional for constants

## Types

has two main catagories of types

-   [scaler types](#scaler-types) represent a single value
-   [compound types](#compound-types) represent a group of values

## Scaler Types

### Integers

rust has signed and unsigned integers

| size    | signed | unsigned |
| ------- | ------ | -------- |
| 8-bit   | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit  | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit  | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit  | i64    | u64      |
| 128-bit | i128   | u128     |

rust also allows you to use the cpu architectures native size with `isize` and `usize`

```rs
let x: i8 = 5; // 8 bit signed
let y: u128 = 5; // 128 bit unsigned
let z: isize = 5; // architecture dependant unsigned
```

### Floats

integers are available in 32-bit and 64-bit

```rs
let x: f32 = 1.0; // 32 bit float
let x: f64 = 1.0; // 64 but float
```

### Boolean

```rs
let x: bool = true;
```

### Characters

in rust characters unicode and take 4 bytes

```rs
let x: char = 'a';
let y = 'ðŸ˜€';
```

## Compound Types

### Arrays

arrays are fixed length

```rs
let x: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

the `5` after the `;` is the size of the array

arrays can be indexed with `[]`

```rs
let mut arr = [3, 2, 1];
arr[2] = 4;
let x = arr[0];
```

### Tuples

tuples are like arrays but each position can be a diffrent type

```rs
let tup: (i32; f32; bool) = (5, 1.0, false);
```

tuples cannot be dynamically indexed but you can access values with `.`

```rs
let mut tup = (5, 1.0, false);
tup.1 = 3.14;
let x: bool = tup.2;
```

tuples can also be destructured like in JavaScript and Python

```rs
let tup = (3.2, 17, 2);
let (a, b, c) = tup;
let sum = b + c;
```

in Rust the empty tuple `()` takes zero bytes and is used as a void

```rs
fn print_message() -> () {
    println!("this function doesn't return anything");
}
```

### Type conversion

type conversion is not done for you. You have to use the `as` key word

```rs
let my_int: i32 = 5;
let my_float: f32 = my_int as f32;
```

## Operators

`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `&&`, `||`, and `!` all work like they do in Java and C/C++

you can also do `+=`, and `-=`

you cannot mix types so you have to convert

```rs
let three: i32 = 3;
let three_fifths: f32 = three as f32 / 5.0
```

## Functions

use `fn` to make a function

```rs
fn main() {
    say_hello();
}

fn say_hello() {
    println!("hello");
}
```

every rust program has a `main` function

you can pass values to functions with arguments

specify a return type using `->`

you can return with `return`

```rs
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    return a + b;
}
```

or by putting an expression on the last line

```rs
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

## Expressions and Statements

in Rust expressions return values and statements do not

examples of statements include

```rs
let mut x = 5;
x = 1;
fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {x + 1}
add_one(3);
println!("hello world");
```

anything that ends in `;` is a statement

examples of expressions include

```rs
5
x
x + 5
add_one(3)
```

you can create expressions using `{}`

for example

```rs
{
    println!("hello world");
    let x = 3;
    x + 2
}
```

is a n expression that prints "hello world" creates a variable called `x` with value 3 and then evaluates to 3 + 2

so we can do

```rs
let a = {
    println!("hello world");
    let x = 3;
    x + 2
};
```

which will set print "hello world" and set a = 5

note that the last line is an expression and doesn't have a `;` just like in a function that returns something

## Condition Expressions

Rust has 2 conditional expressions: [`if`](#if) and [`match`](#match)

### If

this code prints a message if x is less than 5

```rs
if x < 5 {
    println!("x is smaller than 5");
}
```

you can also use `else`

```rs
if x < 5 {
    println!("x is smaller than 5");
} else if x == 5 {
    println!("x is equal to 5");
} else {
    println!("x greater than 5");
}
```

because `if` is a expression it evaluates to a value

```rs
let a = 4;
let b = 7;

let bigger = if a > b { a } else { b };
```

this is similar to doing `(a > b) ? a : b` in Java or C/C++

### Match

match statements allow for multiple cases

```rs
let x = 5;
match x {
    0 => {
        println!("x is zero");
    }
    1 => {
        println!("x is one");
    }
    2 => {
        println!("x is two");
    }
    3 | 4 | 5 => {
        println!("x is three, four, or five");
    }
    _ => {
        println!("x is unknown");
    }
}
```

notice that multiple case can be combined with `|`

`_` is the default case if none of the other cases are matched

because `match` is an expression it evaluates to a value

```rs
let color = match x {
    1 => "red",
    2 => "green",
    3 => "blue",
    _ => "yellow",
};
```

## Loops

there are three was to make a loop in Rust [`loop`](#loop), [`while`](#while), and [`for`](#for)

### Loop

this code prints "hello" the the screen over and over forever

```rs
loop {
    println!("hello");
}
```

`continue` skips to the next iteration
`break` to exit a loop

```rs
fn count(n: i32) {
    let i = 0;
    loop {
        if i >= n {
            break;
        }

        println!("{}", i);

        i++;
    }
}
```

`break` can be used with a value

```rs
let number = loop {
    let user_input = my_input_function();

    if user_input < 0> {
        println!("value must be positive");
        continue;
    } else {
        break user_input;
    }
}
```

### While

`while` breaks if a condition is false

```rs
fn count(n: i32) {
    let i = 0;
    while i < n {
        println!("{}", i);

        i++;
    }
}
```

### For

`for` iterates through a list

```rs
let list = [2, 3, 5, 1];

let mut sum = 0;

for element in list {
    sum += element;
}

println!("{}", sum); // outputs 11
```

you can define ranges with `..`

```rs
fn count(n: i32) {
    for i in 0..n {
        println!("{}", i);
    }
}
```

## Comments

you can add a comment with `//`

```rs
// a comment on it's own line
let x = 5; // a comment at the end of a line
```

## Structs

structs allow multiple pieces of data to be stored together (kinda like tuples)

to define a struct like this

```rs
struct Student {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
    gpa: f64
}
```

you can initialize a struct like this

```rs
let nate = Student {
    name: String::from("Nate"),
    age: 20,
    gpa: 4.0
};
```

and use them like this

```rs
println!("Name: {} Age: {} GPA: {}", nate.name, nate.age, nate.gpa );
```

if you make it mutable you can set it like this

```rs
fn birthday(user: &mut Student) {
    user.age += 1;
}
```

structs muse be entirely mutable or entirely immutable there is no way to make only some fields mutable

## Methods

we can create a method my placing a function inside a `impl` block and s=making it's firs parameter `self`

```rs
impl Student {
    fn birthday(&mut self) {
        self.age += 1;
    }
}
```

the `impl` block is for implementation which includes methods

note: unlike C/C++ ypu can just do `.` and don't need to do `->` or `(*).` because rust automatically references and dereference things in some cases

## Associated Functions

you can also place functions inside `impl` that do not have a `self` they will be associated with the struct but not a method
(like static methods in Java)

```rs
impl Student {
    fn birthday(&mut self) {
        self.age += 1;
    }
}
```

call an associated function using `::`

```rs
let mut nate = Student::build_student(String::from("Nate"), 20, 4.0);
```
